# Hi! I'm Mya Finley
I graduated from Georgia State University with a Bachelors of Business Administration in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Data Analytics. I have worked in a financial data analysis role which provided me with hands on data mining skills using SQL, creating dashboard visualizations with PowerBI, and ad hoc analysis reporting for both internal and external partners. 
    
I chose to become a data analyst as I am passionate about all things data and love being able to transform regular numbers and data into a story that is easy for everyone to understand.
    
I am currently looking for work that will allow me to utilize my skills in SQL, PowerBI, Tableau, and Excel so I can further enhance my career as a data analyst.
